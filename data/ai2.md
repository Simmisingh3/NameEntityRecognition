Support a Total Product Life Cycle (TPLC) approach to the management of AI-enabled devices, including providing recommendations for the design, development, and maintenance of AI-enabled devices.
Help sponsors of AI-enabled devices to identify other relevant guidances to assist them with applying the recommendations in those guidances to AI-enabled devices and support activities throughout the lifecycle of the device.
